                    After teasing fans with singles, Jordan Mackampa brings his soulful voice to a full body of work, as he releases ‘Foreigner’. The album is a snapshot of Mackampa – a confident, honest modern soul singer with a certain swagger about him. Combining deeply personal, inward-looking lyrics with toe-tapping beats, he’s created a fantastic debut album.

                    The project kicks off with ‘Magic’, a feel-good track about the moments a person plays on your mind and you crave time with them, infused with touches of samba. The following songs are peppered with influences from the past that have clearly played a big part in Mackampa’s journey. Soul legends such as Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers clearly influence the music he makes, pairing what have the potential to be timeless vocals with hip-swinging melodies.

                    But it’s the album’s title track, ‘Foreigner’ that stands out the most. The song traces Mackampa’s journey through life: attempting to fit into a new home without losing touch with his roots, the London-based singer embracing both his Congolese roots and his upbringing in the Midlands.

                Lyrics




            </div>

            <div class="title-right">

                Misunderstood at an early age <br>
At an early age <br>
I couldn't read the signs <br>
I couldn't read the pages <br>
I couldn't read the pages <br>
I felt like a stranger <br>
So I didn't speak <br>
I didn't speak <br>
I just said <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
When they spoke to me <br>
I just said <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
Pardon, je n'ais pas compris <br>
As time seemed to pass <br>
And I learned the language <br>
I learned the language <br>
But I felt disconnected <br>
From my mother's tongue <br>
I couldn't understand it <br>
And she looked at me <br>
With such disbelief <br>
When I couldn't speak <br>
I just said <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
When she spoke to me <br>
I just said <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
Pardon, je n'ais pas compris <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
But I seem to find my way around <br>
These complicated foreign sounds <br>
When no one had told me <br>
There would be all of these changes <br>
This city seems an awful place to be <br>
They've poisoned the air I breathe <br>
But I will not stay where I'm not wanted <br>
But I don't want to leave <br>
I don't want to leave <br>
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah <br>
Ah, ah, ah, ah <br>
Ah, ah, ah, ah <br>
Ah, ah, ah <br>
But no matter where I go <br>
(Ah, ah, ah, ah) I'll know where I came from <br>
(Ah, ah, ah, ah) I know where I came from <br>
(Ah, ah, ah, ah) <br>
(Ah, ah, ah, ah) 'cause I speak in the tone <br>
(Ah, ah, ah, ah) Speaks in the song <br>
(Ah, ah, ah, ah) And you know how it goes <br>
When it says <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
When it spoke to me <br>
When it says <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
When it spoke to me <br>
And j'ai pas compris <br>
